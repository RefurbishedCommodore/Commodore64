# Refurbishment plan

The refurbishment plan for this C64 breadbin (several of them in parallell): [^1].

- [x] Refurbish the casing (cleaning, repairing and retrobrighting)
- [ ] Refurbish the casing (cleaning, repairing and retrobrighting)
- [ ] Refurbish the keyboard (cleaning, reviving the plungers and retrobrighting)
- [ ] Refurbish main board (cleaning, checking, repairing, replacing capacitors and voltage regulators, adding heat sinks etc.)
- [ ] Recap RF-modulator
- [ ] Verify operation by testing

The plan can be updated during the refurbishment process. Sometimes I discover areas that needs special attention.

[^1] hello
Here is some inline code```

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Row 1 Col 1 | Row 1 Col 2 | Row 1 Col 3 |
| Row 2 Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 | Row 2 Col 3 |





Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
