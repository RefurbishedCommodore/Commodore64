# Refurbishment plan

The refurbishment plan for this C64 breadbin (several of them in parallell):

- [x] Refurbish the casing (cleaning, repairing and retrobrighting)
- [ ] Refurbish the casing (cleaning, repairing and retrobrighting)
- [ ] Refurbish the keyboard (cleaning, reviving the plungers and retrobrighting)
- [ ] Refurbish main board (cleaning, checking, repairing, replacing capacitors and voltage regulators, adding heat sinks etc.)
- [ ] Recap RF-modulator
- [ ] Verify operation by testing

The plan can be updated during the refurbishment process. Sometimes I discover areas that needs special attention.
